# Message-Manager

This project aims to create a messaging system to manage messages sent via email and WhatsApp, working on them in an asynchronous and scalable way. It also has the functionality to save logs and send personalized messages for each type of subject.

**Note**: The project was based on the premise of being used in another project on my GitHub, this being a vehicle API, so the messages and subjects are configured as such.
